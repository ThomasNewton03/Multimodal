# Shaun MacDonald

I'm Shaun Alexander Macdonald, a HCI Research Associate working with the Glasgow Interactive Systems Section in the University of Glasgow's School of Computing Science. I currently work on the AZRAM project enhancing emotional encounters with social zoomorphic robots with XR. I earned my PhD in Human Computer Interaction under the supervision from Professor Stephen Brewster and Professor Frank Pollick, investigating emotionally resonant vibrotactile comfort objects as a calming intervention for social anxiety. My current research interests are zoomorphic robotics, interactive and immersive prototyping and evocative affective haptics.
