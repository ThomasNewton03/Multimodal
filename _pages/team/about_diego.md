I'm a PhD student specializing in Human Computer Interaction. My current research focuses on using sensory perception and activation to improve the UX of extended reality and on assessing the benefits of multisensory interactions in the metaverse. In addition to my academic journey, I'm currently gaining practical experience as a software developer and UX designer intern at GUSS.
