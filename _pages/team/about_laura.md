# Laura Bajorunaite

I am a PhD student doing research on social acceptability of Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies in travelling contexts as part of the Viajero Project. I have completed my MSc in Human-Computer Interaction with distinction at Nottingham University in 2018. Since then I have worked as a module tutor and a research assistant at Nottingham University and started my PhD in Glasgow in 2019.
