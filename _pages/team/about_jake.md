# Jake Bhattacharyya

I am a PhD student within MIG, working as part of the SONICOM project. My research focuses on audio augmented reality, and how we can integrate virtual sounds into everyday surroundings to inform, assist, or entertain. Specifically, my work focuses on AAR games, and their potential of blending real and virtual worlds through sound.
