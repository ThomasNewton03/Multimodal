# Ammar Al-Taie

I am a PhD student in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. My area of research is Autonomous Vehicle-Cyclist interaction. This often involves utilising unconventional technologies, such as new displays on the car's exterior. I am a "hands-on" researcher; most of my work is conducted in real-world settings using new technologies such as eye-tracking. In my free time, I enjoy running, cycling, reading graphic novels and playing mario kart!
