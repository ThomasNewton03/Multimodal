# Florian Weidner

I am a Lecturer at the University of Glasgow (I joined in March 2025). My research focuses on interaction in AR/VR—particularly with agents and using gaze as a primary input cue. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Lancaster University (2023–2025) with Prof. Hans Gellersen. I worked on multi-sensory XR in the GEMINI ERC project, exploring AR experiences that integrate gaze behaviour and body movements.
