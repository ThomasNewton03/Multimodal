# Stephen Brewster

I lead the Multimodal Interaction group, part of GIST. My research focuses on using multiple sensory modalities and control mechanisms (particularly hearing, touch and gesture) to create a rich, natural interaction between human and computer. My work has a strong experimental focus, applying perceptual research to practical situations.
