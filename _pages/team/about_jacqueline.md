# Jacqueline Borgstedt

I am a PhD student at the UKRI centre for doctoral training in socially intelligent artificial agents with a background in Psychology. My doctoral research explores how multimodal interaction between robots and humans can facilitate reduction of stress and may foster emotional support. Specifically, I am investigating the role of thermal feedback and squeeze input/output during human-robot interaction and its potential for improving psychological well-being.
