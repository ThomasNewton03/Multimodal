We study many areas of human-computer interaction, with a particular focus on multimodal aspects of interaction. A big part of our research is investigating interactions that make the most of what humans are capable of. For example, using audio or haptics to convey information non-visually, or using pressure and gesture for more expressive types of input.

We have a rich history of accessible and mobile human-computer interaction, but in recent years we have also been applying our experience to in-car interfaces, virtual reality, and affective computing.
