You will have the chance to work in the forefront of science in human-computer interaction with world leading researchers.</p> <p>Current Open Positions To do.</p> <p>PhD Opportunities If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send Stephen Brewster an email. State briefly why you are interested and include 1) your CV, 2) your publications list and/or your latest thesis (e.g., MSc thesis or final year project report), 3) highlight the experiences and interests that are relevant to the work we do in MIG, and 4) information about your grades so far. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates.</p> <p>Apart from the open positions, there are scholarships every year offered by the University of Glasgow and others.</p> <p>Scholarships through the University of Glasgow: deadline for the opportunities below is 31 January every year. More info about the application process can be found here: EPSRC Studentship: covers tuition fees at the UK rate and offers a monthly stipend. Non-UK students are eligible but note that tuition fees are paid at the UK rate, and not the international one, so you would need to fund the difference using other means. Deadline is 31 January every year. More info here. College of Science and Engineering Studentship: covers full tuition fees at the international rate and offers a monthly stipend. Deadline is 31 January every year. More info here. Excellence Bursaries: covers the tuition fees fully for UK students, and partially (£10,000) for international students. Note that this scheme does NOT include a monthly stipend, so you need to finance your life expenses using other means. Chinese Scholarship Council nomination: the School of Computing Science can nominate up to 4 candidates every year for the CSC scholarship. It is not guaranteed that the CSC will award our nominees, but historically this has always been the case. Our college then matches this funding to create a fully funded studentship (tuitions + stipend). Industry co-funded Studentships: if you are able to secure half the costs of a PhD studentship from a potential industry partner (currently set at £35,000), I can support you in getting match funding from the University of Glasgow to create a fully funded studentship (tuition fees at the UK rate + monthly stipend). Industry studentships: some companies offer scholarships. Examples include: Google, Adobe, Facebook, and Microsoft. Carnegie PhD Scholarships: highly competitive - more info here. SOCIAL CDT: The UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Socially Intelligent Artificial Agents (or SOCIAL CDT) funds 15 PhD students every year. Dr Mohamed Khamis is part of the supervision team. You would need to select one of projects listed on the SOCIAL CDT website, and apply before the deadline. More details about the eligibility criteria and deadlines can be found on the [SOCIAL CDT website] (https://socialcdt.org/). Post-doc Opportunities There are postdoc fellowships available every year. We are happy to support excellent candidates in their application for a fellowship to fund a postdoc in our group. There are following opportunities (The deadlines were last checked in January 2021, they may have changed since then):</p> <p>Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship: Deadline is in February every year. The Marie Curie fellowship: Deadline is in September every year. The Newton International Fellowship: Deadline is in March every year. The Daphne Jackson Trust: Open call. The EPSRC Fellowship: Open call. The Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship: Deadline is in November every year. The Ernest Rutherford Fellowship: Deadline is in September every year. The Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship: Deadline is in September every year. The Royal Society Research Fellowship: Deadline is in August every year. Note that in addition to the fellowship you can also apply for match-funding from the University of Glasgow’s LKAS scheme to top up your fellowship by £100,000. Master and Level 4 final year projects for University of Glasgow students If you are a student at University of Glasgow looking for a Master or a Level 4 final year project, contact me (or any group member) via email or stop by my office. We often have topics in HCI, Usable Security, Thermal Imaging, Eye Tracking, and Virtual Reality.</p> <p>International BSc / MSc students To do.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> <img src="/Multimodal/assets/img/logos/footer_logos.png" alt="Funded by UKRI, selected by the ERC, hosted at the University of Glasgow" style="object-fit: contain; max-height:10vh;"> <br>© Copyright 2025 Stephen Brewster.
